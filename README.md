!Hidden Charges in Contracts
A Contribution on how hidden charges makes a layer 2 [Scroll] blockchain less trustworthy

The following reasons are made to support my claims  
Opaque Fees: Eroding Trust in Layer 2 Blockchains
The lack of transparency surrounding fees in layer 2 (L2) blockchains poses a significant challenge to their trustworthiness. Several key issues arise from hidden charges:

Reduced Transparency and Predictability:

Unclear Cost Structure: Users grapple with uncertainty regarding the true cost of transactions, hindering effective budgeting and comparisons between different L2 solutions.
Unexpected Fees: Hidden costs lead to frustration and a perception of being misled, damaging user trust.
Complex Interactions and Unforeseen Charges: Integrating with various smart contracts and bridges within L2 protocols amplifies cost opacity, making accurate cost estimation nearly impossible, further eroding trust.
Limited User Control and Choice:

Restrictive Fee Options: Inability to choose fee levels based on individual needs (urgency, budget) creates a sense of being forced into paying potentially high fees, regardless of preference.
Limited Fee Competition: Few L2 options or centralized fee setting reduces user bargaining power, leaving them vulnerable to potentially inflated costs.
Undermining Core Blockchain Principles:

Centralization Concerns: Opaque fee structures can benefit a small group of entities (e.g., validators), raising concerns about centralized control and power imbalances, deviating from the decentralized ethos of blockchain.
Erosion of Trustless Principles: Blockchain thrives on trustlessness, eliminating reliance on centralized entities. Hidden fees contradict this principle, forcing users to trust unknown parties regarding fee structures.
It is crucial to note:

Transparency Exists: Not all Ethereum L2 solutions are plagued by hidden fees. Some offer transparent cost structures with clear breakdowns of charges however exorbitant.
Not Blockchain-Specific: This issue extends beyond L2 blockchains. Traditional financial systems often struggle with similar transparency and user control concerns regarding fees.
Building Trust in L2 Solutions:

Choosing L2 solutions with clear cost structures, user choice, and alignment with core blockchain principles, particularly trustlessness and decentralization, can mitigate the risks associated with hidden fees, fostering a more trustworthy environment for users and developers alike.

Hopefully going forward Scroll will improve on this hereby making it less intrusive for blackhats.
